# 1.2 Editing Scripts and Components.md


These Components and Game Objects are edited to make them compatible to android.

Scripts: 
>EditingManager.cs

>Debug_GUISwitcher.cs

Game Objects:
>ObjectMenu

>ImageMenu

>SpawnCylinder

>ManualDataChannel


## 1.Editing the Scripts

1) The Editing Manager Script can be found in 
>Assets>Harvard>EditingObjects>Editor> EditingManager.cs


Functions to be edited: 
* MobileGUI()
* OnGUI


The **MobileGUI()** method contains code for Initializing UI for Mobile Interface. There is a conditional code in the beginning of the **OnGUI()** method to check for Android application platform and call the **MobileGUI()** method. Copy the scripts for the two methods to incorporate into an android project. 

2) The Debug_GUISwitcher can be found in 

> Assets> XR> Debug_GUISwitcher.cs

Note: There are additional variables created to reference objects. Add this to the project if they don't exist already. 

    //referencing menus and data channel 
    public GameObject channelcontrol;
    public GameObject objMenu;
    public GameObject imgMenu;
    public GameObject spawnCylinder;

    //For enabling/disabling menus 
    public bool channelValue;
    public bool objValue;
    public bool imjValue;
    public bool showAndroidGUI; 
    

Functions to be edited: 
* initMobileObjects()
* start()
* MobileGUI()
* OnGUI
    
    
The **initMobileObjects()** script is used to initialize gameobjects, it is called in *start()*. 
The **MobileGUI()** method contains code for Initializing UI for Mobile Interface. There is a conditional code in the beginning of the **OnGUI()** method to check for Android application platform and call the **MobileGUI()** method. Copy the scripts for these methods to incorporate into an android project.



## 2.Reconfigure Game Objects

Each of the game objects mentioned below have to be reconfigured with parameters to ensure they're compatible with mobile interfaces.</br> 
They all need these two components:

a)Orbital

b)Solver Handler
(Note:Solver handler is added automatically when you add an orbital component) 


### Steps to reconfigure a game object.
1. Searching a Game Object: You can search for a game object in the Hierarchy.

2. Adding the orbital: Once you have selected the component go to Inspector Window > Add Component> Search Orbital

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 and Update Values in the Orbital component for each of the game object as described below.

Note: Each value is crucial to make the application adapt to mobile screen, make the changes prudently.

* Component values for ObjectMenu
