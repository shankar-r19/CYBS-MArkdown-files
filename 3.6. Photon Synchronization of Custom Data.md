#3.6. Photon Synchronization of Custom Data

###Sending custom data through Photon:

PhotonViews can hold data that is synchronized between all players.  Data structures can be sent through the serialization methods provided by photon.

This example shows how to put some variables and the contents of a vector into the photon stream when writing (ie: from the user who is the owner of this PhotonView) and when reading (ie: when received by the other users). For more info see the Photon documentation about IPunObservable (for example this [documentation](https://studios.nomoss.co/blog/pun-basics-simple-synchronization/)).

**The order in which we send variables into the photon stream…**

**…must match the order in which we receive variables from the photon stream.**
